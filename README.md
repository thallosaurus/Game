## Blocks and Orbs
This Game is a small Proof Of Concept. I don't think this will ever be done, but it seems you're interested in it.

# Features
The Game itself has no real features (NOT YET) and consists of the ideas I had.

- Reads Level File out of a text file (easy mapping)
- is written in Java
- Runs on a Java Canvas

# How do I map?
So, it's relatively simple (as long as you can use a text editor, m8).

You create a 24x18 chunk of zeroes (0) and fill it with these numbers whereever you want them, as long as they are inside the chunk.

- 0: Nothing. The Void surrounding us all.
- 1: A Wall.
- 2...8: Unused for now
- 9: A precious BetaOrb coming soon
